## Project P9 – Pattern Printing Tool

## Project Details

•Project No: P9

•Project Title: Pattern Printing Tool

•Topic: Numeric Pattern Logic

•Technology Stack: C, VS Code, GitHub

## Project Aim

The aim of this project is to design a Pattern Printing Tool that generates different numeric patterns based on user input using nested loops, without using arrays or any additional storage.

This project focuses on strengthening logical thinking and loop control in C programming.

## How the Program Works

1: Decide the number of rows to be printed.

2: Take the number of rows as input from the user.

3: Use an outer loop to control the rows.

4: Use an inner loop to control the columns.

5: Use the loop counter to decide which number to print.

6: Print numbers inside the inner loop.

7: After each row, move to the next line.

8: Repeat the inner loop for every row.

9: Continue until all rows are printed.

10: No array or extra storage is required.

## Expected Output
•Displays numeric patterns on the console.

•Output varies based on the number of rows entered by the user.

•Patterns are printed row by row.
