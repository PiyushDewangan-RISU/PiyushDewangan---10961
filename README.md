## Project P9 – Pattern Printing Tool

## Project Details

•Project No: P9
•Project Title: Pattern Printing Tool
•Topic: Numeric Pattern Logic
•Technology Stack: C, VS Code, GitHub

## Project Aim

The aim of this project is to design a Pattern Printing Tool that generates different numeric patterns based on user input using nested loops, without using arrays or any additional storage.
This project focuses on strengthening logical thinking and loop control in C programming.

## How the Program Works

1.The user enters the number of rows to be printed.
2.The program uses an outer loop to control the rows.
3.An inner loop is used to control the columns.
4.Loop counters determine which number to print.
5.Numbers are printed inside the inner loop.
6.After completing each row, the cursor moves to a new line.
7.The process repeats until all rows are printed.
8.No array or extra memory is used.

## Expected Output
•Displays numeric patterns on the console.
•Output varies based on the number of rows entered by the user.
•Patterns are printed row by row.

## Tools & Technologies

•Programming Language: C
•Code Editor: VS Code
