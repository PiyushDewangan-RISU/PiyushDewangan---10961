Pattern Logic Tool
Project Title: Pattern Logic Tool
Developer: Piyush Dewangan
Roll No: RU-25-10961
Project ID: P9

📌 Project Overview

The Pattern Logic Tool is a C-based program designed to generate various numeric patterns based on user input.
This project focuses on building strong logical thinking using nested loops, without using any arrays or extra storage.
The tool takes the number of rows as input and prints number patterns efficiently using loop counters.

🎯 Aim of the Project

• To create a pattern printing tool that:
• Generates numeric patterns based on user input
• Uses nested loops only
• Avoids arrays or additional memory storage
• Enhances understanding of loop control and logic building in C

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: C

🧩 Logic Used (Step-by-Step)

1.Decide the number of rows to be printed.
2.Take the number of rows as input from the user.
3.Use an outer loop to control the rows.
4.Use an inner loop to control the columns.
5.Use loop counters to decide which number to print.
6.Print numbers inside the inner loop.
7.After completing each row, move to the next line.
8.Repeat the inner loop for every row.
9.Continue the process until all rows are printed.
10.No array or extra storage is required.

📤 Output

•Displays numeric patterns on the console
•Output varies based on user input
•Patterns are printed row by row
